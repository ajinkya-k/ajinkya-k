Hi I'm Ajinkya, 

I am a graduate student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison advised by [Prof. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/). 
I am pursuing research in causal inference, machine learning and decision making. 
Currently, my work focuses on heterogenous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference for social networks. 
Prior to joining UW-Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). 
I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Economics from BITS, Pilani. 
My CV and contact details can be found on my [website](https://ajinkya-k.github.io/).
