Hi I'm Ajinkya, 

I am a graduate student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin--Madison advised by [Prof. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/). 
I am pursuing research in causal inference, machine learning and decision making. 
Currently, my work focuses on heterogenous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference for social networks. 
Prior to joining UW-Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). 
I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Economics from BITS, Pilani. 
My CV and contact details can be found on my [website](https://ajinkyakokandakar.com).

**Open Source Code:**
I have experience writing software [packages](https://github.com/ajinkya-k/flexBCF/tree/bcf_het_u/) and [modules](https://github.com/ajinkya-k/nsyr-matching-testing/) in R/C++. I also contribute to open source projects especially in the Julia and R ecosystems, see a summary of my contributions [here](https://ajinkya-k.github.io/opensource.html).
I also dabble in Rust programming.
